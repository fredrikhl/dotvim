# Vim dot-files

My vim setup with [pathogen] and [pandemic], with common settings according to
my preferences, and possibility for different configs for individual hosts.

See [doc/dotvim.txt] for more info.

## Setup

1. Clone this repo to '~/.vim:
   ```bash
   git clone <this-repo> ~/.vim
   ```
2. Install [pandemic] and fetch bundles:
   ```bash
   bash setup.py
   ```
